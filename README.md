This project demonstrates automated testing of the Agoda hotel booking flow using **Robot Framework** and **SeleniumLibrary**. It simulates a user journey from searching for hotels to reaching the final page before payment.

### ✅ Features Covered
- Open Agoda homepage
- Search hotels by city
- Select travel dates
- Add rooms and travelers
- Filter by price and accommodation type
- Select and view a hotel
- Fill in guest contact details
- Choose special offers (if available)
- Proceed to the final step before payment

### ⚠️ Why the Credit Card Payment Step Is Skipped
To ensure **security**, and to avoid potential **legal or ethical issues**, this automation **does not simulate credit card input** or complete any actual transaction.

The goal of this project is to showcase proficiency in UI automation with Robot Framework, with a focus on test design and the hotel booking flow — **not on simulating real payments**.
